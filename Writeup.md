One thing I learned during this project was that since Java objects are passed by reference, adding and removing from a linked list can be modularized.  You can take the node to be removed or the node before or after which a new node is to be inserted, and pass it as an argument to a function which handles all the pointer reassignment.  This makes the code much simpler and more concise.
